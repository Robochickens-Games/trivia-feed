-- Copy and paste these commands into a direct psql connection to the database
-- Do NOT run these in the Supabase SQL Editor
-- These must run outside any transaction block

-- 1. Connect to your database (replace your_database_name with your actual DB name)
\c your_database_name

-- 2. Run vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM FULL VERBOSE public.user_feed_changes;

-- 3. Update statistics for query planning
ANALYZE VERBOSE public.user_feed_changes;

-- 4. Check table size after optimization
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('public.user_feed_changes')) as table_size;

-- NOTE: If you don't have direct psql access, you may need to run these commands
-- through another connection method or ask your database administrator to run them for you.
