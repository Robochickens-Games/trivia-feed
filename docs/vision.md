Subject: Our MVP Will Define a Category  
Date: April 28, 2025

Team,

I've reviewed our progress on Trivia Universe. We're not building another trivia app. We're creating a new category that will fundamentally change how people engage with knowledge.

Our MVP ships in 60 days. Not 61. What follows are the essential features that must be flawless. Everything else is a distraction.

## 1. Category Creation Experience

The creation flow must be so intuitive that a 12-year-old could build a compelling trivia category in under 5 minutes. This is non-negotiable. It should feel like magic.

Our AI assistance should quietly elevate the quality of user-created content without being intrusive. Users should feel like geniuses when they create something with our tools.

If category creation isn't delightful, nothing else matters. This is the foundation of our entire ecosystem.

## 2. Adaptive Difficulty Engine

I want players to lose track of time because they're in a perfect state of challenge. Too easy, they get bored. Too hard, they get frustrated.

Our system must invisibly calibrate to each player within 7 questions. The algorithm should feel like it's reading your mind.

When testers say "how did it know exactly what to ask me next?" – that's when we've nailed it.

## 3. Discovery Mechanism

Users won't search for categories. They'll discover them through perfect recommendations.

The best categories should rise to the surface naturally. Not just popular ones – surprising ones that match a user's unique interests.

When someone opens the app, they should immediately see content that makes them think "this was made for me."

## 4. Learning Capsules

The learning elements must be bite-sized, visual, and feel like rewards, not lessons.

When a player misses a question, the knowledge gap should be filled immediately with something that sticks. This isn't about forcing education – it's about satisfying curiosity at the perfect moment.

These capsules should leave players thinking "I can't believe I didn't know that" instead of "I feel stupid for missing that."

## 5. Social Proof Integration

Every action in the game should have subtle social validation attached to it. Players should always know where they stand in relation to others without feeling intimidated.

"5,234 people have mastered this category" is powerful. It creates aspiration without creating intimidation.

## What We Will NOT Do

We will not ship with 50 features that are all mediocre. We will ship with these 5 features that set a new standard.

We will not overdesign. The interface should disappear, leaving only content and interaction.

We will not compromise on performance. The app must launch in under 2 seconds and respond to every tap in under 100ms.

## Final Thoughts

Remember why we're building this: to transform passive entertainment into active growth. To make curiosity social. To create something that becomes more valuable every time someone uses it.

Our competition will try to copy features. They cannot copy our vision.

One more thing: when people try our MVP, I want to see that look on their faces. You know the one. When they realize they're experiencing something entirely new. That's how we'll know we've succeeded.

Get back to work. Make something insanely great.
